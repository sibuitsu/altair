Some of the key features and benefits of Edgecam 2011 R1 are:
 
- **Enhanced Collision Detection**: Edgecam 2011 R1 provides complete peace of mind with further collision detection for both milling and turning, including tool, holder, turret, head, fixture and table collisions. With Edgecam 2011 R1, you can have confidence that your toolpaths are collision-free using Edgecam's Machine Tool Simulator[^1^].
- **Part Modeler**: Edgecam 2011 R1 includes Part Modeler, a powerful manufacturing solid modeling solution that has been enhanced to deliver users greater assemblies manipulation. Part Modeler allows you to create and modify solid models with ease and accuracy[^2^].
- **Strategy Manager**: Edgecam 2011 R1 features Strategy Manager, a powerful automation tool that allows you to capture and apply your best practices for machining operations. Strategy Manager now has updated and an increased number of strategies included[^2^].
- **Edgecam Toolstore**: Edgecam 2011 R1 provides users with the most powerful Edgecam Toolstore to date. Enhancements to the toolstore enable users to merge toolstores together retaining tool, material and job information, allowing for transfer of toolstores between departments or even a different factory[^2^] [^3^].
- **Composite Feature**: Edgecam 2011 R1 introduces a new composite feature that enables users to collect together their roughing cycles on the same plane to improve toolpath efficiency[^2^].
- **Roughing Cycle for Milling**: Edgecam 2011 R1 improves the roughing cycle for milling to provide users significant time savings in toolpath calculation with benchmark tests showing that some users will benefit from a five-fold reduction in calculation time[^2^].
